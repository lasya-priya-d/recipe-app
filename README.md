# Recipe-App

This is our project for the course Web Technologies. It is a basic recipe app which allows the user to create and view recipes, which basically has the application of serving as a user's very own cookbook. We made this by implementing MERN stack and a few related technologies. 
Please find below the required files of code along with the powerpoint presentation (UE19CS204 – WT – Recipe App Project Report) about our project.
